This chat application is a simple web-based interface built with Flask, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It allows users to type messages and receive responses from an AI assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The user interface is clean and responsive, providing a seamless chat experience where user messages and AI responses are displayed in a conversational format. The Flask backend handles message processing, sending user input to the AI model, and returning the AI's response to be displayed in the chat. This app demonstrates the integration of modern AI with a straightforward web application, making it a useful tool for interactive conversations.
